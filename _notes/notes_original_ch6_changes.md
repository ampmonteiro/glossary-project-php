# Notes of original ch5 changes -> ch6 &#9989;

## since this is continuation of previous chapter with improved ch5, here few changes:

- compare with full original that is on master branch or on a branch called complete original 

- on mysqldataprovide.class.php use interface instead of extend another class &#9989;

- i had to implement type hint, since interface has too. &#9989;

- in the views was necessary to change from array assoc to oop way too, since in PDO is using glossaryterm class to map the results into objects. &#9989;
